## 🎯 Objectives

- Improve **clinical decision-making** through AI-driven knowledge retrieval  
- Provide **personalized patient recommendations**  
- Reduce errors by offering **evidence-based responses**  
- Enable **scalable and cost-effective knowledge delivery** in healthcare and beyond  

---

## 📊 Key Features

- 🔍 **Knowledge Retrieval (RAG Framework)** – Ensures responses are grounded in verified medical data  
- 🧠 **Agentic AI** – Task-oriented AI agents that handle patient triage, symptom checking, and report summarization  
- 🏥 **Healthcare Use Cases** – Clinical documentation, patient Q&A, treatment plan suggestions  
- 🌐 **Cross-Industry Applications** – Telecom, IT, and cloud industries for knowledge automation  
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics** – Accuracy, precision, recall, latency, and user trust

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Medical datasets, clinical guidelines, knowledge bases  
   - Cleaning, normalization, and embedding generation  

2. **Model Development**  
   - LLMs fine-tuned with healthcare datasets  
   - RAG pipeline for evidence-based answers  
   - Agents orchestrated for specialized tasks  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Human-in-the-loop validation  
   - Metrics: F1-score, accuracy, hallucination reduction, response latency  

4. **Deployment**  
   - APIs for EHR/EMR integration  
   - Scalable microservices architecture  
   - Role-based access for clinicians and staff
